title: Owe

One of the things I hate the most is the feeling that I owe someone something. That because someone smiled at me, the least I can do is smile back. Usually things like that are small. But I feel like this obligation of owing someone something has caused me to do things I don't want to and to stay in toxic relationships with people longer than I should.

I especially hate the phrase "欠人情", which Google Translates roughly translates it to owe a favor. Some things get lost in translation.

I give owing anything a one star
