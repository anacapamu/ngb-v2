[Stickii Club](http://www.stickii.club/) offers three different types of monthly sticker subscriptions: Cute, Pop, and Retro. The packs are differentiated by color: pink for Cute, purple for Pop, and yellow for Retro. Each pack is 10 USD per month plus tax and shipping.

I bought this pack during the 50% off sale back in July for around $8 with shipping. The past packs are available in the store for usually around 13.99 USD plus shipping. I love everything ocean-related, so picking up this pack was a no-brainer for me.

In the envelope is a (I believe the size is A5) storage insert that contains all the goodies. Each pack also comes with a pink ring for you to hold all your inserts together if you do not have or want to buy a 6-rings binder.

The miscellaneous goodies in this pack: whale bookmark, mermaid paper clip, and a secret message in a bottle embroidered patch sticker. From other reviews on this pack, I know that there is variation for the whale bookmark (not going to lie but I think I got the best one). I am glad that the patches are stickers because I cannot sew but I am not sure how and where I am going to use this.

There are 8 designs for the watercolor flakes. They are transparent, which is why I had to use a blue background. They also feel thin because they are made of the same material as washi tape.

There are three non-exclusive sticker sheets: one on buried treasure and two on various fish.

There are three Stickii Club exclusive sticker sheets: one on mermaids, one on whales and axolotl, and another one on random ocean items.

**Overall impression:** I like that Stickii Club is producing more exclusive sticker sheets and I think that really makes their subscription stand out. I am still not a subscriber as I tend to be a sticker hoarder more than a sticker user. I think I used maybe one sticker from the first pack I bought from them more than a year ago.
