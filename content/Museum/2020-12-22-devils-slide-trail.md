    <figcaption>Devil's Slide used to be a part of Highway 1 and was infamous for closures due to landslides. The Tom Lantos Tunnels replaced it in 2013; and the 1.3 miles paved highway was then converted to a multi-use trail that connects the north and south parking lots.</figcaption>

The Tom Lantos Tunnels separate the north and south parking lots. Both of the two parking lots have an upper and lower lot; but there are less than 40 spots in total, so it was extremely hard to find parking on a Saturday.

    <figcaption>I didn't know trees can grow on the side of bluffs. (I just found out that a <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/bluff/">bluff</a> is a small, rounded cliff that usually overlooks a body of water.)</figcaption>

    <figcaption>The trail is mainly flat but there are some steep uphill sections. According to <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/devil-s-slide">AllTrails</a>, the steepest section has a 9% grade.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>There were a lot of signs warning about landslides, and some of the bluffs had nets on them to hold the rocks in place.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>There are benches, viewing scopes, and interpretive signs along the trail. This interpretive sign describes in detail the restoration effort for the common murres on Egg Rock.</figcaption>
</figure>

We didn't see any common murres on the trail, but according to [Audubon](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/common-murre), the common murre looks like a penguin and can have blue or green eggs.

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/l1OK1TH.jpg" width="451" height="601" alt="Devil's Slide Bunker" />
    <figcaption>The Devil's Slide Bunker can be viewed from the south parking lot. According to <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/devil-s-slide-bunker">Atlas Obscura</a>, it was used as a triangulation and observing station during World War II.</figcaption>
</figure>

The bunker is on private property, and there is a huge sign telling people not to trespass. However, it is not fenced, and we saw several people climbing up towards the bunker.
