We were discouraged from drawing growing up because "artists don't make money." Since I do not have much experience drawing and I am not committed enough to take classes, I figured the best way to start is by copying other people. Even though I chose a drawing that I thought was simple, I still had a hard time. I clearly cannot freehand draw ovals or align objects. I know I will need to practice a lot more to be even remotely decent, so expect to see more of these posts.

I have included the original piece that I copied below. I do not know who the original artist is as I found this on Pinterest. If you are or know who is the original artist, please let me know so that I can credit them properly.
