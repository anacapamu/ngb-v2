Hong Kong Disneyland is located on Lantau Island and it is easily accessible by MTR. This was my first time visiting a Disneyland so I was beyond ecstatic.

The park consists of seven themed areas: Main Street, U.S.A., Fantasyland, Adventureland, Tomorrowland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, and Toy Story Land. For some reason, I only took pictures of Toy Story Land so that is all I can share. They are currently doing construction on Sleeping Beauty's castle so we did not get to take pictures there.

One of the first things I noticed when I stepped into the park was Disney-themed eggs. There were a lot more scattered around the park than what I took pictures of. I am not sure if they have these year-round or only during the Easter season.

I like that the longest time we had to wait for a ride was 30 minutes and it was for the very short and anti-climatic Winnie the Pooh storybook ride. The wait for Hyperspace Mountain was 5 minutes during the morning and the afternoon. So if you enjoy more thrilling rides like my boyfriend, you can go on that ride multiple times without fast passes.

My favorite ride in the entire park is the Ant-Man and the Wasp: Nano Battle, which opened March 31, 2019. We went three times in total but only because we had fast passes as the line for this interactive ride was quite long. I beat my boyfriend the first time, but subsequently lost to him the next two times. Maybe because it is new, but this ride had problems every time we were on it. Sometimes we would not get points when we shot a target or the ride would temporarily stop for a minute or so.

We ate lunch at the Royal Banquet Hall in Fantasyland because you can choose from a variety of cuisine: pizza, pasta, ramen, dim sum, etc. I ordered from the Guang Dong section. The royal seafood fried rice with scallops combo was HKD$142 (USD $18.09) and the piggy pork bun was HKD$38 (USD $4.84). Theme park food is almost always overpriced cafeteria food but these dishes surprisingly did not taste too bad. I splurged and upgraded the drink from my combo to the Minnie Mouse sip sip cup. I think it was USD $5 for the upgrade but I do not remember. I was surprised that they filled the cup with a Calpico-like drink and Mickey Mouse-shaped lychee jelly, which is much tastier and cuter than the Sprite I would have gotten if I did not upgrade.

Throughout the park you can buy cute Disney-themed ice cream, etc. These Disney-themed donuts are from the Main Street Bakery. We did not end up getting any because we were too full and I do not usually eat much sweet anyways.

Despite the humidity, I had a great time. While Hong Kong Disneyland is smaller than the original Disneyland in Anaheim, I enjoyed the shorter lines and the cheaper general admission ticket. Right now, the price of a general admission one day pass is only 639 HKD (81.40 USD).
