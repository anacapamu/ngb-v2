Using calendars as desktop wallpapers makes me feel more productive at work. I used to download my monthly wallpaper from [Emma's Studyblr](https://emmastudies.com/tagged/download) but she suddenly stopped updating back in August. I got tired of waiting around for her, so I decided to make my own desktop wallpapers and share them here. If you would like to use them, just right-click the image and save it to your desktop.
