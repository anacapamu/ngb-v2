Steyr is the third largest town in Upper Austria. The Steyr and Enns Rivers flow through the region and meet beneath Lamberg Castle and St. Michaels' Church.

The photos in this post were taken on March 13, 2019. I do not have much to write about Steyr as we only passed by the old town while driving to Linz. We stopped to take pictures but it started raining, so we did not walk around or explore the town.

While Steyr is an extremely beautiful town, I cannot help but think about floods that impacted and will impact the lives of the past and current residents. Why would people want to build an entire town right between two rivers?
