Instead of studying for my exam, I thought it was a good idea to make a digital weekly planner at midnight. Since I am not an active digital bujo (bullet journal) planner, I only created sections for the days. I will probably play with it more in Notability and add or remove features.

This weekly planner is available for download as a PDF for free. I have included two versions: one with a Monday start and another with a Sunday start. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please let me know.

- [Weekly Planner 001 (Sunday Start)](/static/downloads//wp-001-sun.pdf)

I have also included the color palette used as I know I am going to want to use it to make something else.
