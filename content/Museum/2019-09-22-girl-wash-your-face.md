**Review:**

Wow, what a long title! But do not let that be the reason you pass on this book. After all, the title accurately describes the set-up of the book. Each chapter is structured around a lie that Rachel used to believe and how she overcame it. While this book is published as a self-help book, I like to think of it more as an autobiography since I do not relate to some of the issues she faced as a rich, white, and religious woman. However, I did enjoy learning about her background and her perspectives on juggling four children and a successful event planning business.

There are two main reasons why I did not like this book as much as I would have liked to: the Christian references and her relationship with her husband. Rachel was upfront that this book was published by a Christian publisher. While she did not excessively repeat bible verses, she did make outlandish comments such as how porn and premarital sex are bad. I also thought the timing of some of her religious phrases seemed out of place, as if she sprinkled them in for quota purposes. While I found the religious references annoying and ingenuine, her story about her husband made me pause the audiobook for days.

Spoiler alert - do not continue reading if you hate spoilers!

She described the emotional abuse her husband, then boyfriend, put her through. He would invite her to bars so she could watch him flirt with other women. He got upset at her when she told people at a party that he was her boyfriend. She gave up her virginity to him in hope that he would not break up with her, but he still did. The list of abuses just goes on. She finally gathered up the courage and self-respect to tell him to stop contacting her, and he shows up at her doorstep the next day begging her to take him back. And guess what... she did! Ugh, come on!

She knew readers would be upset because she made the disclaimer that most relationships like the one she described would never work. While I am happy that she was able to smooth things over with her husband, I do find it unbelievable that a person can change his mentality and behavior so drastically overnight.

Despite the aforementioned negative aspects of the book, I still thought it was interesting and funny enough to finish. Rachel narrates the audiobook, and she has a slight lisp that is not noticeable if you listen to your audiobook at 1.5x speed or faster. I would definitely recommend the audiobook because she did a great job making the listeners feel like she is their BFF, sharing stories and giving advice.
