[Penny and Grace](https://www.pennyandgrace.com/) is a subscription service that sends three assorted jewelry pieces (necklaces, rings, earrings, or bracelets) in silver, gold, or rose gold every month for $19.99. You can customize your ring size (6, 7, or 8) and opt out of receiving earrings if you do not have pierced ears or do not care to get more earrings.

**Review:** When I first received this bag, I thought the pieces were kind of boring. Yet I ended up wearing the earrings almost daily to work because they give off a classy but not showy vibe.

I ended up cancelling my Penny and Grace subscription after receiving the April 2018 bag as I was not enticed by the spoilers, upset about the discontinuation of the enamel pins, and disappointed with the overall quality of the pieces. They stopped sending the pins starting with the April 2018 bag, and the reason given was because they were bringing "great" changes to the bag. However, it is now May 2019 and nothing has changed and the pins are still not back!

While I know that these are cheap costume jewelry, the quality is slightly better than jewelry from Forever 21. The rings do not leave green residues on my fingers. However, after a year of frequent use, the gold plating on my ring has tarnished and the ring overall looks bronze instead of yellow gold. I also question the quality control because a chain from one of my bracelets broke off the first time I wore it.

In conclusion, Penny & Grace is a great subscription service for ladies that want to expand their costume jewelry collections with minimalist and fun pieces. They have a theme every month, so the pieces usually match with each other. However, at my age and with my current fashion taste, I prefer fewer but longer-lasting pieces that match most of my outfits.
