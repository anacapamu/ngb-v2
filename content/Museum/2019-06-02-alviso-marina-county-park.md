Alviso Marina County Park is a small bayside park, where you can get a great view of the Bay Area mountains and

the salt ponds and marshes of the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge.

I think the border between the park and the refuge is hard to differentiate since they are right next to each other.

However, you know you are on the Alviso Slough trail when you walk past the iconic yellow house-like gate.

Parking is free and we did not have a difficult time finding parking on a Sunday afternoon. But that was probably because it was very sunny that day and there is no shade in this park.

The restrooms and picnic tables are next to the parking lot.

You can see private residential houses along the trail near the parking lot.

The trail is extremely flat, so it is easy for hiking, walking, or biking. Across the salt pond, you can see the Amtrak Coast Starlight trains go by.

This is a small park but there are areas that are off limits. We did not see much wildlife that day but I did see a lot of broken down docks and pipes.
