I have been sheltering-in-place in my apartment for the past nine days and I needed to find something other than watching stupid chick flicks on Netflix to do. Coloring is a relaxing activity, and since the popularity of adult coloring a few years ago, no one says adults can't color anymore.

I don't have a printer, so I had to improvise and color with my iPad. The good thing is that I have an Apple Pencil; otherwise, coloring on an iPad would be extremely difficult. I browsed around the web and found this adorable free coloring page from [Imps and Monsters](https://www.impsandmonsters.com/downloads/). I opened the PDF with the Notability app and started coloring. I soon realized that I could only color with the highlighter, as the pen would cover the drawing. After 20 minutes or so, my wrist started hurting (damn you, carpal tunnel), so I stopped. I only colored six little guys because it was hard to not color outside the lines. I was also having difficulty maintaining the same pressure/amount of strokes, which caused some of the colored creatures to be lighter or darker in certain areas. I definitely need to find an app designed specifically for coloring if I want to continue to do this.
