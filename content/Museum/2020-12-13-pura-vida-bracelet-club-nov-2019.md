Pura Vida has two monthly subscription boxes: Bracelet Club and Jewelry Club. I subscribed to the Bracelet Club and I get three bracelets each month (up to USD 50 value, according to their website). It is $14.95 a month including shipping but it is cheaper if you prepay for 3 months or a year.

<figcaption>The envelope this time is an accordion, and the pocket is shaped like a pineapple, which is adorable. The mission is now printed on the envelope instead of the card.</figcaption>

<figcaption>How cute is the little pine cone charm? I got a mountain bracelet in the <a href="/Museum/2019-10-05-pura-vida-bracelet-club-apr-2019">Apr 2019</a> pack, but this one is a bit bigger and green. While I don't usually wear anything green or brown, I think this pack was very well curated and I see myself using these often together or separately.</figcaption>
