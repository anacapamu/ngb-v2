Stickii Club offers three different types of monthly sticker subscriptions: Cute, Pop, and Vintage. The packs are differentiated by color: pink for Cute, aqua for Pop, and gold for Vintage. Each pack is $10 per month plus tax and shipping and comes with at least six sticker sheets and at least three stationery items.

Unlike the March pack, I was actually excited to receive this one. So excited that I ripped the envelope.
