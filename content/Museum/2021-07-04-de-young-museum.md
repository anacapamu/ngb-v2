The cover photo highlights Hamon Observation Tower but not the actual museum. Since I didn't think of taking a photo of the museum, it will have to suffice. (Hamon Observation Tower is part of the de Young museum and offers 360 degree panoramic views of downtown San Francisco, Golden Gate Park, the Bay, and the Marin headlands. It is free for the public but has been temporarily closed due to the pandemic).

de Young is currently offering free Saturday admissions for all Bay Area residents. Before the pandemic, they only offered free museum days to SF residents; so I was excited to take advantage of this offer. I made a reservation online and when I got to the door, they didn't care to check my ID or ask for proof of residency.

They did require everyone to wear a mask, but a lady coughing the entire time near us made us uncomfortable; so we left within an hour. The de Young has a lot of oil paintings - extremely large ones too. They also had wooden furnitures and lots of different tablewares. I included photos of some of the pieces that intrigued me during the brief visit.
