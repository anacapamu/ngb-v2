A group of friends wanted to go to Downtown Disney District for Pokemon Go a couple summers ago. I tagged along since I have never been to Downtown Disney. As someone who isn't obsessed with Disney and doesn't usually shop, I was bored.

In 2018, parking was free for three hours if you made a 20 USD minimum purchase at any of the Downtown Disney shops. (I remember because I ended up buying a Minnie ears hat from a store to get validation for parking.) Due to the pandemic, parking is now only $10 per car for the whole day.

I clearly enjoyed the Lego store though.
