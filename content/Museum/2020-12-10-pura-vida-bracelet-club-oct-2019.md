I am trying to get rid of as many of my drafts as I can before the start of the new year, so there will be quite a bit of outdated posts over the next few weeks.

Pura Vida has two monthly subscription boxes: Bracelet Club and Jewelry Club. I subscribed to the Bracelet Club and I get three bracelets each month (up to USD 50 value, according to their website). It is $14.95 a month including shipping, but it is cheaper if you prepay for 3 months or a year.

<figcaption>They change the color and design of the bag every month, which is kind of cool as I can use them for junk journaling. This month, they collaborated with Peach's Neet Feet for National Bully Prevention Month.</figcaption>

<figcaption>The back of the mission card is different even though the front is the same as the one I received for the <a href="/Museum/2019-10-05-pura-vida-bracelet-club-apr-2019">April 2019</a> pack.</figcaption>

<figcaption>Since this is the October pack, they went for a somewhat Halloween theme with the black color palette and the skull. I am not a fan of skulls, but they made this one cute with a flower on top.</figcaption>

<figcaption>I am very happy with the bonus bracelet because of the simple "Be Kind" reminder and the cyan color.</figcaption>

<figcaption><b>Review:</b> I like this subscription box because I would wear the bracelets frequently and I use the large laminated stickers on my laptop or water bottle. However, I only subscribed to three boxes and I am already wondering if I truly need more than ten bracelets. Sucks that they are too small to be anklets.</figcaption>
