**Title:** *Botanical Line Drawing: 200 Step-by-Step Flowers, Leaves, Cacti, Succulents, and Other Items Found in Nature*

**Author:** Peggy Dean

**Rating:** ★★★★☆

This book is divided into four sections: leaves, flowers, cacti and succulents, and more nature. There are a lot of varieties (supposedly 200 but I didn't count), so I was able to pick and choose plants that I enjoy drawing and can draw. Most of them are easy, but there are some that are more difficult.

My biggest complaint is that I wish the author told us what we are drawing. None of the drawings are labeled and I am not an expert in plants (I don't even know how lavender looks like); so I had no clue what I was drawing most of the time. My other complaint is that all the cacti and succulent drawings were in some sort of pot or terrarium. I would rather learn how to draw individual cacti or succulents instead. Despite these two complaints, I do recommend this book to anyone interested in adding some botanical variety to their drawings.
