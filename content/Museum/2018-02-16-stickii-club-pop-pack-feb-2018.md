Subscription boxes are the hype nowadays. The first box I tried was a beauty one from Amazon a few months ago. I don't think that box really counts since you can only get the box once and they give you the entire payment back in Amazon credits.

Nonetheless, I have been extremely obsessed with subscription boxes these past two months; reading reviews and researching various boxes every day. I finally decided to try out some subscriptions myself this month.

[Stickii Club](http://www.stickii.club/) offers three different types of monthly sticker subscriptions: Cute, Pop, and Retro. The packs are differentiated by color: pink for Cute, purple for Pop, and gold for Retro. Each pack is $10 per month plus tax with free shipping.

Based on the sneak peeks, I decided to get the Pop pack since I love traveling (even though I have yet to travel a lot but that's a whole different story).

    <figcaption>All the stickers were packed neatly into each pocket of the storage insert. However, the bike paperclip was just in the envelope. I think they should have placed it in one of the pockets of the insert to prevent it from getting lost or falling out. The material for the insert is smooth and feels like it is made from good material.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>I thought they were not going to give me the plastic binder ring to hold my storage inserts together, but it was hidden behind the theme sticker in the insert. (If they put the ring in the insert, why can't they put the bike paperclip in it too?)</figcaption>

    <figcaption>The theme of this pack is "Into the Wild" and they provided more theme stickers in various color schemes. The window is empty for the two smaller stickers. I guess that means I can create my own environment for the astronaut. Though I would have to do that with other stickers as I would not be able to draw on the laminated surface.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>This sticker sheet is the reason why I wanted to get this pack! The art is so pretty and I love that the artist combined the themes of planets with sea animals in such a colorful way. It is printed on washi paper, so it can be a little fragile to peel off.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>This is my second favorite sheet from the pack! The sceneries placed in geometric shape gives off the snapshot vibes.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>The packaging made me a little sad. I had a hard time separating the galaxy sea animals sheet from the scenic geometric shape sheet when I took them out of the insert. Even though I slowly pulled them apart, one of the geometric stickers still got stuck on the back of the galaxy sheet. These two sticker sheets are made of different materials and should not have been placed right on top of each other.</figcaption>

**Review:** I think that this sticker pack is super cute and I can definitely see myself using quite a few of the sheets, which is surprising because I tend to be a hoarder. I can appreciate the storage insert they provided to hold and protect my stickers, and it definitely adds value to the subscription. I am just not sure if I will be continuing the subscription long term as I can only use so many stickers a month. In addition, 10 USD a month can get quite pricey for a few sheets of stickers. You can find a lot of these exact or similar stickers on Alibaba for 1 USD or less.
