I think I am a teensy bit addicted to paint by numbers. I got this kit from Amazon for $11, so almost half of the price of the [Great Wave off Kanagawa one](/Museum/2020-09-12-pbn-great-wave-off-kanagawa) I got from Etsy.

The kit included the usual canvas, colored sticker render of the painting, a paper reference sheet of the canvas, 24 wells of paint, 3 paint brushes, and 2 wall hooks. The manufacturer rated this kit as 3 out of 5 difficulty.

**Day 1 (45 mins)** - The canvas was folded and not rolled, so I ironed the back on high heat. The wrinkles are less apparent but still there.

I always spend the first day swatching because a) I like swatching and b) the swatch is useful as a reference in the end when I am doing touch-ups.

**Day 2 (2 hours)** - I started with the darker colors and moved from large to small areas.

**Day 3 (1.5 hours)** - I am starting to notice why this kit is cheaper. While the color from *The Great Wave off Kanagawa* kit did not match the original painting perfectly, the black on the bottom of this painting looks more like an oil spill than shadows.

**Day 4 (1.75 hours)** - I am quite sure that numbers 12 and 20 are the same color.

**Day 5 (2.75 hours)** - This painting is a lot more difficult than *The Great Wave off Kanagawa* as there are a lot of little patches to fill. There are also more colors to work with.

**Day 6 (1.5 hours)** - The tips recommend you go from left to right (if you are right-handed) and from top to bottom. I tend to like to do the painting by quadrants instead.

**Day 7 (2 hours)** - For the light colors, I had to do several layers. For the white color, I had to do at least five layers. Fortunately, I had more than enough paint for each color to complete the painting.

**Day 8 (3 hours)** and **Day 9 (3.25 hours)** - I took a one month break on this painting and most of the paint did not dry out. For the few that did, I added a few drops of water in the well, mixed, and continued to paint like usual.

**Day 10 (2.5 hours)** and **Day 11 (2 hours)** - I spent the last two days doing touch-ups. This painting took a total of **23 hours**. While the colors do not match the original painting, I had fun.
