[Penny and Grace](https://www.pennyandgrace.com/) sends three assorted jewelry pieces (necklaces, rings, earrings, and bracelets) in silver, gold, or rose gold every month for $19.99. You can customize your ring size (6, 7, or 8) and opt out of receiving earrings if you do not have pierced ears or do not care to get more earrings.

The hand-painted llama enamel pin is so cute! I think I received the llama pin in error because it was included in the January subscription. February subscribers got an "Ooooh la la" pin. However, I like the llama pin way more, so it is a wonderful mistake.

On a side note, I don't know how I feel about their logo. It looks like a Christian cross, which can mislead people.

I have seen a few reviews and Instagram posts of this box and it looks like everyone received the same necklaces and bracelets. I am wondering if there is a variation besides the ring size and color.

> I don't really care for a Je t'aime necklace but apparently stamped necklaces are all the rage nowadays.

I really like the double heart lariat necklace. I have always wanted a heart necklace but have yet to find one that I liked. This is my first lariat necklace and I managed to separate the two pieces when I unclasped the necklace. Luckily, it is really easy to put back together.

The heart bracelet is cute but I have yet to use it. I already have scrunchies and a watch on my wrist, so I am not sure if I really have space for it.

**Review:** I do not have much jewelry, so everything I received is a welcome addition to my collection. I also want to try other colors in future months so that I have a variety for my collection. I am definitely a minimalist girl, so all the pieces were a hit with me. Also, the customer service is responsive and friendly, so I can definitely see this subscription being a long-term one for me.
