I was at the Google Sunnyvale campus for an event back in February 2019. The following is a view of the event center (MP7) from Building MP3.

After the event, a friend from Google gave us a tour. He told us that every Google campus has a secret meeting room and that the method to get into the room and the layout of the room are unique to the campus. The secret room isn't accessible to the public, so you will need to know a Google employee to get in it.

We went to a floor (I forgot which floor as we were searching around for this) in Building MP3 and found a wall of doors. Only one of these doors work. Which one do you think is the real one?

We really thought the little blue one was the real door and that we had to crawl into the secret room; but it is actually the green one! The handle doesn't actually work as my friend had to scan his Google employee badge along the wall next to the door to open it.

The secret room is a speakeasy named Chalmun's, a reference to Star Wars. There was a record player, glasses, sofas, etc. but no liquor (we double-checked all the cabinets and shelves).
