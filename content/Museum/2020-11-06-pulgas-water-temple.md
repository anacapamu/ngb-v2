[San Francisco Water Department](https://www.sfwater.org/index.aspx?page=93) built the Pulgas Water Temple to commemorate the completion of the Hetch Hetchy system, which supplies [85% of the Bay Area's water](https://bawsca.org/water/supply/hetchhetchy). The ancient Greek-style temple was designed by William Merchant and completed in 1938.

Ever since I saw photos of the temple a year ago, I have wanted to admire it in person; but it was not really convenient to visit, even pre-COVID. It closed early at 3:30 PM and the parking lot is closed on the weekends. The temple was closed during the first few months of COVID-19 lockdown; but I recently saw people posting about it, so I figured it must be open now with restrictions lifting in the area.

Quite a few Google reviewers said they got ticketed parking along Cañada Road, so we parked at a dirt lot known as Edgewood-Cañada Parking 1.7 miles away. There is a designated dirt path on Cañada Road for walking and running. It wasn't very steep, but there is not a lot of shade; so, definitely apply sunscreen in advance! Almost all the people we encountered were biking.

As of September 2020, the parking lot and temple ground are CLOSED until further notice. The side gate is opened for passersby and bikers to get water and/or to use the porta potties from 9 AM to 3:30 PM. We didn't know about the closure beforehand; but since we hiked 2 miles, we decided to quickly check out the temple. Don't do what we did! We got lucky because as we were heading back, we heard a sheriff sternly scold the people lingering there.

The water fountain is right by the parking lot. According to the sign, this water exceeds all federal and state criteria for both tap and bottled water quality. I slightly regret not trying the water but I didn't have a water bottle on me and I am paranoid enough about COVID-19 to not want to drink straight from a public fountain.

There were several informational signs about the Hetch Hetchy system and the temple along the path to the temple.

The inscription on the ring reads "I give waters in the wilderness and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people," which is from Isaiah 43:20.

I have included a short clip of the well from the temple above. Enjoy the sounds of birds and water!

View of the reflecting pool and the cypress trees from the steps of the temple. The ground is extremely well-kept and would definitely make a great picnic spot once it is open again.
