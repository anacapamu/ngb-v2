Stickii Club offers three different types of monthly sticker subscriptions: Cute, Pop, and Vintage (used to be Retro). The packs are differentiated by color: pink for Cute, aqua (used to be purple) for Pop, and gold for Vintage. Each pack is $10 per month plus tax and shipping and comes with at least six sticker sheets and at least three stationery items.

I bought this pack and the [Aug 2018 Cute Pack](/Museum/2019-11-06-stickii-club-cute-pack-aug-2018) back in July 2019, during Stickii Club's birthday sale. Each pack with shipping and tax ended up being only $8.50, which I think is a steal.

Since this is a 2018 pack, they were still giving out the plastic binder rings. The three stationery items for this pack are a bunny sticker patch, squirrel paper clip, and a memo pad.

Wow, this is a large sticker flake pack! There are nine designs and seven of each design. The cut on some of the stickers isn’t great, but the quantity made up for the quality. Each of the sticker flakes is sweet-scented.

The artist featured in this pack is Sophie Wu (@sophiewuwork, she changed her handle on Instagram). I like how cozy this sticker sheet is with the soft pastel colors.

The soft pink color palette continues with this washi strawberry jam sticker sheet.

How cute is this alpaca sticker sheet? (I had to Google the difference between alpacas and llamas. Llamas have a more elongated face and banana-shaped ears, while alpacas have smaller and shorter ears; so these are definitely alpacas.)

I love how classy these ducks are with their little hats and necklaces; but most importantly, they still look like they have fun. (I didn’t realize how bad I am at identifying animals until I started reviewing this sticker pack. I believe these are ducks and not geese because of the little ducklings and because of the shape of their bills.)

A simple but useful sheet with hearts and pigs.

The pig theme continues in this sticker sheet. (I feel like these are emojis for Line or something, but I am not sure since I don’t really use messaging apps anymore.)

And finally, we have the wolves from the “Country Livin’” theme.
