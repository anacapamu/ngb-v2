Belvedere consists of two palaces, Upper Belvedere and Lower Belvedere, the Orangery, and the Palace stables. The Upper Belvedere Palace houses the art museum, Ã–sterreichische Galerie Belvedere. Since I did not know I was visiting Belvedere, I did not do any research about the area beforehand and most of my pictures will be of Upper Belvedere.

There are many sphinx statues throughout the Belvedere. This specific one with the child is in front of Upper Belvedere.

I did not take any pictures of the art pieces since most of them do not allow flash photography and I can only admire art on a superficial level anyways. This picture is taken in the two-story Marble Hall.

The Marble Hall features a ceiling art piece by Carlo Innocenzo Carlone.

<p style="clear:both;">I included a lot of shots of the garden from the Marble Hall and from the ground of Upper Belvedere. You can see Lower Belvedere directly down the hill with the red roof.</p>

I regretted not walking through the garden and seeing Lower Belvedere. Since I visited Belvedere with a group that was born in Austria and lived in Vienna for years, they did not care to walk around in the sun to see structures that they pass by every day commuting to work.

Even though I did not get to see everything the Belvedere offered, I was still amazed by how beautiful and grand everything was. I really enjoyed sitting on the steps outside and inside the Upper Belvedere and imagining how life was like back in the days.
