I haven't posted about paint by numbers for almost a year because it took me a year to work on and to give up on this piece. I started this painting at the end of October 2020 and decided to finally toss it in the trash mid-September 2021. I had a hard time giving up on it because I already spent 29.75 hours working on it, which is more time than I spent on the other two paint by numbers.

I got this from the same Amazon seller as the [Whale and the Boat paint by numbers](/Museum/2020-11-18-whale-and-the-boat) kit. I think these kits normally go for around 10 USD, but I paid less than 6 USD plus tax as it was on sale. The Whale and the Boat piece had a difficulty rating of 3 stars, while this one had a 4-star rating out of 5. I wish the seller told you somewhere on the listing about the difficulty level because this kit is definitely not for beginners.

**Day 1 (1.75 hours)** - I always like to start out with a swatch because I like to see all the colors available while checking if any of the colors are already dry. Swatching also helps in the end as I can easily refer to it instead of the reference paper to add more layers to a specific part.

**Day 4 (7.5 hours after Day 1)** - I am beginning to notice that some colors are too thin/light to cover up the lines and numbers. It is hard to tell by the photo, but all the yellows required multiple layers and I don't know if the manufacturer provided enough paint to accomplish that.

**Day 5 (4.25 hours)** - Some of the numbers are so small that I had to guess what it is. The corresponding number on the reference sheet is also illegible.

**Day 8 (2.5 hours)** - At this point, I realized a few of the colors I needed had dried up. The drying is partially my fault as I could have probably closed the caps more tightly.
