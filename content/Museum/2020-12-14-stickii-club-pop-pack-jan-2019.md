Stickii Club offers three different types of monthly sticker subscriptions: Cute, Pop, and Vintage (formerly Retro). The packs are differentiated by color: pink for Cute, aqua (used to be purple) for Pop, and gold for Vintage. Each pack is $10 per month plus tax and shipping and comes with at least six sticker sheets and at least three stationery items.

I bought this pack during Stickii Club's website migration sale for $8.50 including shipping and taxes (a steal for packs!). Since this is an old pack, the envelope is still purple for Pop.

The three stationery items for this pack are a memo pad, washi tape, and an origami crane paper clip.

The theme of this pack is *The Shape of Dreams*, so there will be a lot of geometric shapes. The 12 clear silver foil sticker flakes are shapes within shapes (shape inception).

This colorful sticker sheet of circles, while simple, will be definitely a useful one.

This is my least favorite sheet in this pack. The triangles and the bright colors give me a childish and obnoxious birthday vibe.

This sticker sheet would be useful if I had a bullet journal but I don't. I will probably find some way to use it in my scrapbook as I don't have any day or number stickers.

I am not sure how to describe this sheet... random shapes from the 80s?

They are really making this pack for the bullet journalers with these decorative infinity symbol stickers.

This is my favorite sheet in the pack. I like the colors and the art within each geometric shape is very iconic of the Pop packs.
