Stickii Club offers three different types of monthly sticker subscriptions: Cute, Pop, and Vintage (formerly Retro). The packs are differentiated by color: pink for Cute, aqua (used to be purple) for Pop, and gold for Vintage. Each pack is $10 per month plus tax and shipping and comes with at least six sticker sheets and at least three stationery items.

I bought this pack along with the [Jan 2019 Pop pack](/Museum/2020-12-14-stickii-club-pop-pack-jan-2019) during Stickii Club's website migration sale for $8.50 each, including shipping and taxes. Since this is an old pack, the envelope is still purple for Pop.

The theme of this pack is *Chic Living*. I thought this would be a great pack to get to journal the stay-at-home days of 2020 (and maybe 2021 with the rate of infection in the U.S.). There are only two stationery items in this pack: a lounger paper clip and a dresser memo pad.

There are eight sticker flakes of mostly women chilling at home: playing records, playing guitar, reading, etc.

The next three sheets are of various furniture, mainly chairs.

I have never seen such a large window sticker before.

A sticker sheet of women chilling at home and outside?

I love architecture and these colorful houses are adorable.

This sheet arrived dirty, so I messaged Stickii Club. I got a response within a few hours and received the replacement within five days.

Not only did they send a replacement, they sent two sticker sheets as freebies; what great customer service!
