I tend to hoard things like stickers and washi tapes. I figure one way to start using my collection is to display them via swatches. When I googled "wash tape swatches" to see if the word "swatches" should be singular or plural, I noticed that people had very creative ways of displaying their washi collection. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people.

    <figcaption>I have a lot of Aliexpress washi tapes because they are so affordable but you get what you pay for. Some of them don't stick as well and would curve towards the end. The patterns might not be cohesive too (look at the third and fifth washi tapes from the first image).</figcaption>

    <figcaption>OK, the Hello Kitty ones are not washi tapes as they do not have the paper-like textures. But I love using them to decorate the lids of pasta jars for reusing purposes.</figcaption>
