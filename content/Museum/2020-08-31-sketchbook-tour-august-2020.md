While I have mainly stayed inside for the past five months because of the pandemic, I was still able to go out a few times a week to hike, clear my mind, and get some fresh air. However, with the whole state of California on fire for the past two weeks, I have been stuck at home moping around. I do have a few backlogged posts to finalize and review, so I hope September will be a more productive month!

I have a tendency to want to fill up the pages and not waste any spaces but I want to stop doing that and create more standalone pieces. The following drawing is based on one of my stuffed animals - [Fiesta Lil Huggy Stan Shark](https://cdn3.volusion.com/9nxdj.fchy5/v/vspfiles/photos/FA-A65466-3.jpg?v-cache=1594393707). She is not very photogenic but she is really cute and squishy in person!
