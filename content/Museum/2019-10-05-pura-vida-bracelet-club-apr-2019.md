Pura Vida has two monthly subscription boxes: Bracelet Club and Jewelry Club. I subscribed to the Bracelet Club, in which you get three bracelets each month (up to USD 50 value). The Bracelet Club is $14.95 a month with shipping but it is cheaper if you prepay for 3 months or a year in advance.

<figcaption>Even though I subscribed in September, I received the April 2019 pack. I was a little disappointed because they did not tell me before confirming my order or before shipping that I would not be receiving the September pack. I know that in the description under the subscribe button they did mention that if they run out of the current pack, they would ship another "exclusive" pack; but I still believe that they should have let the subscriber know before shipping the pack. Nonetheless, since this is my first pack with Pura Vida Bracelet Club, I am not too upset because these are not repeats.</figcaption>

<figcaption>The bracelets in the pack are designed to complement each other, but I have worn each separately or with other Pura Vida bracelets. I like wearing the thinner ones more than the braided one because I think the thinner ones are more summer-like and they have cute charms. (I know it is technically fall now but 85Â°F weather makes me feel otherwise.)</figcaption>

<figcaption>I am going to have to find a way to deal with the extra string left after tightening the bracelet. I know that people suggested cutting them, but I don't really want to have to burn the wax to seal them. I also like the idea that if my wrist gets bigger, I can still wear these bracelets.</figcaption>

**Review:** If you love or are interested in getting Pura Vida bracelets, I definitely recommend trying out the subscription. Bracelets without charms are already $6 each, so it is much cheaper to get three bracelets for $15. In addition, the bracelets in the pack are made to complement each other, and if you suck at making things match like me, then this makes being fashionable a lot easier. I also like that these bracelets are inclusive. Regardless of the size of your wrist, you can wear these bracelets. The wax coating also caters to lazy people like me who do not like to take off my bracelets every time I wash dishes or shower.
