    <figcaption>This page in my sketchbook is actually colored, but I scanned it in black and white to avoid bleed-through from the other side.</figcaption>
</figure>

This was the only sheet in my sketchbook that I drew on the back and front. I don't want to waste paper though, so I need to figure out how to make sure the back does not bleed through while scanning or how to edit the bleed-through out of the scan. Honestly, I probably should edit scans of my sketchbook more often so I don't look like such a bad artist.
