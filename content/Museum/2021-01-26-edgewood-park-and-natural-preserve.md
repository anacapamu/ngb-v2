Edgewood Park & Natural Preserve in Redwood City is [famous for their spring wildflowers](https://parks.smcgov.org/edgewood-park-natural-preserve). Unfortunately, we visited in late fall, so there weren't any flowers.

You can enter Edgewood Park through the main parking lot or through one of the three trailheads - Edgewood, Clarika, or Sunset. (Sunset Trailhead does not seem to have a designated parking lot though). No matter how you enter the park, you will have to climb uphill. We parked at the main entrance and headed up Old Stage Road. This trail is very steep; so if you are out of shape like me, take the Edgewood Trail around the Bill and Jean Lane Education Center for a more gradual and slower walk uphill.

According to [Friends of Edgewood](https://friendsofedgewood.org/), there are more than 500 plant species, 100 bird species, 21 mammal species, 13 reptile and amphibian species, and countless invertebrates at Edgewood. We didn't really see much except mule deers. It was my first time seeing deers so close to the trails though.

I got a new phone and was testing out the optical zoom, which isn't that good since the deer in the photo is pixelated. However, I really like the colors of the sunset in the background, so I am sharing the photo anyways.
