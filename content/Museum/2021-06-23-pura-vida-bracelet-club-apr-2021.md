Pura Vida has two monthly subscription boxes: Bracelet Club and Jewelry Club. You get at least three bracelets each month (USD 45+ value, according to their website) when you subscribe to the Bracelet Club. It is $14.95 a month including shipping; but it is cheaper if you prepay for 6 months or a year. Every month, you can choose between two different styles.

The mailer this month is different from the January, February, and March one. So, we figured it out! They change the mailer quarterly.

The info cards are still the same though. I wish they didn't include them since they are a waste of paper and ink. I do like this month's sticker as it really captures the Arizona desert vibe with the colors, cactus, and rocky terrain.

The two packs available this month are [By the Sea and Key West](https://www.instagram.com/p/CNK9DpHJbQj/). I apparently chose Key West, since that is what I received. I think it is annoying and a tad shady that you can't see your selection after the pack ships. I remember being torn about the decision because I love everything ocean related but I also wanted a snake chain bracelet. In addition to the snake chain, there are a cyan braided bracelet with a sea shell-like charm and a beaded bracelet.

I had to look up Key West to try to understand the reference. It is a city in Florida known to be the southernmost point in the U.S. It is famous for watersports, nightlife, beaches, conch-style architecture, pastel, etc.
