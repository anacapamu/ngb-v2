While doing research for this post, I discovered that Liberty Park was prominently featured in the Disney show *[Andi Mack](https://film.utah.gov/blog/living-it-up-with-andi-mack/)* (I am a little too old to know of this show).

Anyways, Liberty Park is the [oldest and second largest park](https://www.slc.gov/parks/parks-division/liberty-park/) in Salt Lake City. We visited on a random April weekday and there were barely any people at the park.

Surprisingly, and also unsurprisingly at the same time, there is not a lot of information on the web about Liberty Park. Since I was there almost three years ago, I don't really remember everything I saw or did.

I do remember thinking this abandoned building looks cool, but I don't know if I ever figured out what it was used for.

There is a pond with two islands.

Unfortunately, I didn't really get a good image of the islands, but you can kind of see one on the middle right edge of the photo. The island to the left of the dock has a gazebo and you can get to it by crossing a bridge.

I believe this fountain with a bird statue on it is between the pond and the aviary.

We walked around the entire park, but I didn't take photos of everything in the park. It is a shame because Tracy Aviary and Seven Canyons Fountains are the main attractions of this park.
