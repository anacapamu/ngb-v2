[EarFleek](http://www.earfleek.com/) sends subscribers a pair of earrings each month for USD 3.49. You can also upgrade to their premier tier, which is $9.93 a month. They have three styles: silly & fun, minimalist but groovy, and boho babe for both tiers. I think I am a minimalist but groovy gal, but I ended up choosing silly & fun because I wanted studs and not drop earrings.

<figcaption>The pink polka dots really give off a retro pre-1960s vibe, which I kind of dig. The envelope is small and easily fits in most mailboxes.</figcaption>

<figcaption>Rachel S is the stylist for all reviews of EarFleek orders I have seen online. My main question has always been: Is that a picture of Rachel or just a stock photo that EarFleek bought online? I guess we will never know.</figcaption>

<figcaption>The goodies are a pink scrunchie and heart-shaped earrings. I guess they are going for the pink color theme because of Valentine's Day. I am not really feeling the scrunchie and from the comments I have seen, people think it is kind of tacky. I don't typically use such thick scrunchies like this one. I tested the rubber band by stretching it a couple of times and it seems to not be weak.</figcaption>

<figcaption>Pink is definitely not my color and the heart within a heart design is too cheesy for me; thus, these earrings are a miss for me. I have worn them for the whole day a couple of times now without any irritation to my ears, so they are nickel-free like EarFleek promised.</figcaption>

**Review:** EarFleek is definitely one of the cheaper monthly subscription boxes out in the market. Even if you subscribe to the same style as me for the month, you may not get the same earrings as I did. This has been a problem because some people have been getting the same earrings twice a month or the same earrings for two different types of subscriptions.

While these earrings are not the highest quality, they are definitely better than the Forever 21 ones. They are nickel-free and do not irritate the skin. Also, it is delivered to your door for free every month so you can save time and gas from having to drive to a store. Obviously, the downside is that you cannot choose your earrings and can end up with a miss like I did.
