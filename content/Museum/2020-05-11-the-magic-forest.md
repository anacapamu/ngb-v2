I got baited by the name and Yelpers in thinking that The Magic Forest was a lot bigger than it actually is. One Yelper said this place had 50 redwood trees, but I feel like there were more like 30. (Disclaimer: My estimation skills are terrible, so I would believe him if I were you.)

The Magic Forest is a grove of redwood trees on Hopkins Street in Palo Alto and a "special interest" of the 19-acre Rinconada Park. It is dedicated to Edith Ellery Patton, an elementary school teacher in the nearby Walter Hays School. She was known to read to her students in the shade of the tall redwood trees ([source](https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/news/displaynews.asp?NewsID=118&TargetID=14)).

We did not spend more than five minutes here since there were no paved roads in the grove and the ground was wet. But I can definitely see this as a peaceful place to read or relax.
