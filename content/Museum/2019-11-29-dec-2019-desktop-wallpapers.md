I think the hardest part of making these calendar desktop wallpapers is ensuring that the spacing between the dates is consistent. I am getting better, but I still have room to improve.

I have included five different calendar wallpaper designs below that are Christmas and/or snow-themed. If you would like to use one, you can just right-click the image, save it to your desktop, and then set it as your desktop wallpaper.
