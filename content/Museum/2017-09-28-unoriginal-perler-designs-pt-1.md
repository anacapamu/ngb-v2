I started playing with Perler beads last year.

I have given away most of the Perler sprites I made as I find it more enjoyable to make things for others than for myself. I have included pictures below of the Perler sprites that I do have on me and the ones that I took pictures of before I gave them away.

DISCLAIMER: I made the following Perler sprites based on designs I found on Google and Pinterest and thus, I do not know who the original artists are.
