Pura Vida has two monthly subscription boxes: Bracelet Club and Jewelry Club. For the Bracelet Club, you get at least three bracelets each month ($45+ value, according to their website). It is $14.95 a month including shipping, but it is cheaper if you prepay for 3 months or a year (I saw a Facebook ad that said March 2021 is the last month that they are offering the discounted 3-month prepaid tier). Something that changed since I last got this subscription back in 2019 is that you can choose between two styles every month.

I really wanted the Self Love pack from the February 2021 spoilers and being a sucker for deals, I prepaid for 3 months. I was able to select the pack I wanted the moment I subscribed. Unfortunately, they sent me the January 2021 Laguna pack by mistake. I contacted customer service (use the live chat, they never answered my email) and they quickly sent me the Self Love pack and told me I could keep the Laguna pack.

As always, you don't want to throw away the fold-out card without checking inside for the sticker of the month. This time, the sticker is exactly the same as the mailer. The microbus, palm tree, and surfboard is giving me a summer vibe even though it is January.

According to the [spoiler](https://www.mysubscriptionaddiction.com/2020/12/pura-vida-bracelets-club-january-2021-spoilers.html), there should be six bracelets in total for the Laguna pack but I only received four. Since I essentially got this for free, I am not complaining. The four bracelets included are 1) aqua original bracelet, 2) aqua braided bracelet, 3) aqua bead chain bracelet, and 4) a white bracelet with a wave charm and some silver beads.
