Rockaway Beach is a beach in Pacifica with brown sand. There isn't much about this beach on the web since it isn't as popular as Mori Point to the north and Pacifica State Beach to the south.

There are no steps or a paved path down to the beach - you will have to climb over the rocks.

I like that there are several free spacious beach access parking lots. This beach tends to be popular with surfers, which is probably why there are quite a few signs warning about the rip currents around the entrance to the beach.

On Rockaway Beach Trail, there is a rail in front of the building with Moonraker and other restaurants. From the rail, you can get great views of the shoreline.

According to this interpretive sign, you can see whale migrations here throughout the year. Unfortunately, we didn't see any whales, dolphins, or seals during our visit.

Nick's Seafood Restaurant is the oldest restaurant in the area according to Wikipedia, but I don't see such a claim on their website. We didn't eat there but we did notice that they really don't like non-customers parking in their lot.
