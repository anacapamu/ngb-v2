Pura Vida has two monthly subscription boxes: Bracelet Club and Jewelry Club. You get at least three bracelets each month (USD 45+ value, according to their website) when you subscribe to the Bracelet Club. It is $14.95 a month including shipping; but it is cheaper if you prepay for 3 months or a year (I saw a Facebook ad that said March 2021 is the last month that they are offering the discounted 3-month prepaid tier). Every month, you can choose between two different styles.

I used the photo from the [January 2021 pack](https://ninagetsbored.wordpress.com/2021/03/07/pura-vida-bracelet-club-jan-2021/) since the mailer and the fold-out card are the same. I thought it was a fluke since this pack was sent as a replacement; but from eBay listings of resellers, it appears that these are the mailers for February. I am guessing they either got lazy or ordered too many January mailers and postcards.

The sticker is different from last month and the design aligns with the theme of love, so this is definitely the February pack. I believe you get the same sticker no matter which style you pick.

Like I mentioned in my January 2021 pack post, I subscribed because I wanted the Self-Love pack. I like that this pack feels classier and more suitable for business casual wear than previous packs.

There are actually three bracelets in total. The pearl and rose gold links are parts of one bracelet. I never had two bracelets in one, so I thought that was cool. In addition to the double chain bracelet, there is a pink crystals bracelet and a rose gold coin bracelet.

Wow, I never noticed how hairy my forearm is before seeing this photo...
