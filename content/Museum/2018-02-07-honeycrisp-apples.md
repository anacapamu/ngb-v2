I ate apples when I was young because the cafeteria at school served them and because my mom would buy them. I stopped eating apples when I went to college because I realized they were quite expensive and not really tasty. Plus, you can eat a banana during a lecture without making too much noise or mess.

I recently got interested in apples because of a trending [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYnyMPc3LQ4) I saw on YouTube. Inspired by the content of the video, I looked into apples. When you google "how many varieties of apples are out there," the first link that shows up is from the [University of Illinois Extension](https://extension.illinois.edu/apples/facts.cfm). Apparently, there are 7,500 varieties of apples and 2,500 of those varieties grow in the United States. I knew that there were many different types of apples but I did not know that there are *that* many varieties.

I decided to try different types of apples just like Jaiden did in her YouTube video. I wanted to try something I had never tried before and I did not want to start this research project off on a bad note, so I went for honeycrisp apples. People rate them highly and they are expensive, so they must be good, right?

I got two honeycrisp apples with different PLU codes. I am not sure if the different numbers make a difference. The stickers tell us how that fruit was grown. Four numbers on both apples mean that they were conventionally grown. Even though these apples are not organic, they still cost $1.99/lb at Sprouts Farmers Market.

**Review:** The Chelan apple was less crispy and more tart than the other apple. I enjoyed the crispiness of these apples but I got sick of the sweet taste after two slices of each. This apple research project is going to take me a long time to complete if I have to take three days to finish two apples...
