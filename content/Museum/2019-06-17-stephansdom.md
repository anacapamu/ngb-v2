Stephansdom (St. Stephen's Cathedral) or "Steffl" is an iconic Gothic structure in Vienna. Its massive south tower is easy to pinpoint in the first image of my [Das Loft Bar](/Museum/2019-06-01-so-vienna-das-loft) post.

I visited Stephansdom near sunset and there were a lot of people inside and outside of the cathedral. I had a hard time taking photos because of the insane amount of visitors and because of the sheer size of the church. I also think it is a shame that you cannot avoid the large advertisement banners in your photos.

I did manage to get a good picture of the mini version of the cathedral, which illustrates how tall the south tower is.

The interior was dark and crowded. They also closed off most of it to tourists. To take this photo, you have to position the camera between two metal bars or above the metal gate.

I visited Austria during Lent, so you can see the "Sky of Stones" in this photo. According to [Secret Vienna](https://secretvienna.org/sky-full-of-stones-stephansdom/), the stones are lighted purple during Lent, golden during Easter, and red until Pentecost.
