I left my job to focus on my mental and physical health, so I was able to finish this month's challenge very quickly. I am considering getting a Skillshare subscription to get a foundation in art and to improve my drawing skills. Unfortunately, they have a lot of art courses and this means I will have to do a lot of work on my end to curate and to filter quality courses.

    <figcaption><strong>04 - Sail</strong><br><br>I see a lot of Youtube artists use red colored pencil to sketch, so I attempted to do that here. I definitely have some gaps in knowledge here. Is Prismacolor too hard to erase or am I using the wrong kind of eraser? Should I be using a certain type of marker to cover the red pencil markings?</figcaption>
