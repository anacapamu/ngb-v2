    <figcaption>Avenue of Stars is the Hong Kong version of Hollywood Walk of Fame. They honor famous actors, directors, etc. with plaques along the 440 meters promenade. The promenade is extremely beautiful, modern, and clean as it just reopened from redevelopment on January 31, 2019. There is not much shade, so if you want to sit near trees you will have to go to the Salisbury Garden nearby. They have a few restaurants such as a pizzeria near the Bruce Lee statue and some stalls sprinkled throughout the promenade selling snacks like durian ice cream, boba, etc.</figcaption>

<p>If you take the MTR to Avenue of Stars, you will see signs that direct you to either "Avenue of Stars" or "Garden of Stars." Following either signs will lead you to where you want to go; they just did not update all the signs. During the three years redevelopment period, the statues and plaques were temporarily hosted at the garden, known as "Garden of Stars."</p>

    <figcaption>The view of Victoria Harbor from the promenade is breathtaking! There is not much else to do on the promenade but there are quite a few chairs along the promenade you can sit on and just relax and take in the scenery.</figcaption>

<p>I am sad to have missed the light show though. If you are at the promenade around 8pm, you can watch the light and sound show called A Symphony of the Lights. We unfortunately had to leave to get to a birthday party, but the show is on my list of must do when I go back to Hong Kong.</p>
