    <figcaption>The Utah State Capitol is a gorgeous Corinthian-style building. We hiked up there from Temple Square and boy, it was quite steep (mainly because I am extremely out of shape).</figcaption>

    <figcaption>This is the first state capitol I visited, so I did not know that you can actually go inside and that they offer free guided tours daily.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>This is the view of the Council Hall while standing on the steps of the Capitol building. I love seeing the snow-capped Wasatch and Oquirrh mountains in the background.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>Yoshino cherry trees line the Memorial Walkway that encircle Capitol Hill. You can see the tower of the Council Hall in the top left corner of this picture. We visited early April, so we got to see the beautiful cherry blossoms!</figcaption>

There were not a lot of people around, so we had a great time relaxing and enjoying the views. I would definitely recommend that you check out Capitol Hill if you are ever in Salt Lake City.
