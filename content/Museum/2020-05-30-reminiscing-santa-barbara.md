I took an intro to photography class at a local community college to force myself to use my camera more (I haven't used my DSLR much after the class, so that was a fail). To complete assignments, I took a bunch of photos downtown where I worked. While I have not been back since I moved in 2016, I am still amazed at how beautiful the buildings are there, and I am glad I have these photos to remember the year I spent in Santa Barbara.
