Stickii Club offers three different types of monthly sticker subscriptions: Cute, Pop, and Vintage (formerly Retro). The packs are differentiated by color: pink for Cute, aqua (used to be purple) for Pop, and gold for Vintage. Each pack is $10 per month plus tax and shipping.

I usually vibe more with the Pop or Cute packs, but I really liked the Vintage pack for this month. Since 2018, everything in the pack comes in an A5-sized insert.

Each pack comes with at least six sticker sheets and at least three stationery items. The stationery items this month are a memo pad, bookmark, and two chocolate-themed notecards. Surprisingly, there was no special paper clip in this pack; maybe they haven’t been including it as often as they did in 2019 (I am clearly not that up-to-date with all their changes). I disliked the bookmark when I first saw it in the spoiler and I dislike it even more in person.

If you haven’t guessed it yet, the theme is *Let it Snow*! While I have never ice skated before, I think this sheet showing different ice skating poses is cool.

The artist featured in this pack is Carolina Parada (@carosurreal). I like how warm and cozy this fall-themed sticker sheet is, though I am not sure how this relates to snow.

This Japanese winter sticker sheet reminds me of woodblock prints.

Washi tape sheets are in nowadays, though these are a little too long to use for journaling as I don’t want to cut the art in half or in thirds.

I think this sheet is the closest to Christmas-related than anything else in this pack. Stickii Club really tried to avoid putting in Christmas stuff for those that do not celebrate it.

Silver foil washi baking stickers that are old-school style. I can see why these are in the Vintage pack, but not sure how it is related to snow. Do people bake more in the winter?

Gold foil clear stickers of mainly leaves are very fall-themed and cozy, but am I the only one that associates snow with winter and not fall?

**Review:** Stickii Club has come a long way since I first bought from them back in 2018. They are no longer using sticker flakes and sticker sheets that you can find on Aliexpress for cheaper. All the sheets are unique, and I love that they are collaborating with other artists. Have I finished using all the stickers I have bought from them in the past two years? Of course not! But I am scrapbooking now, so I will definitely be using my stickers more.
