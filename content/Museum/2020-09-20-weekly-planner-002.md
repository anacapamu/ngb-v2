I finally took the plunge and am testing out digital bullet journaling. This weekly planner is available for download as a PDF for free. It is not suitable as a printable as I did not leave enough room to hole punch. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please let me know.

I have included an example of how I use this weekly planner in Notability below.

I have never done a weekly spread like this on paper before as I don't have the money to buy sticker kits nor do I have patience to beautify my daily to-do lists. Since I am exploring digital bullet journaling, I thought I could try out these weekly spreads I see all over Tumblr and Instagram.

Probably due to a mix of inexperience and lack of sets of digital stickers, this entry took me several hours to complete. I am also confused about whether or not the entries should be in past or present tense. In all the *Plan with Me* videos on YouTube I watched, people were entering the posts after-the-fact, which is counterintuitive for planning but would work if these served as mini diary entries. I will keep on experimenting and will provide updates and/or other freebies.
