There were no signs along the two miles we walked to indicate what the actual name of this trail is; so, I am combining the name of the following two sources: [Rhorri](http://www.rhorii.com/RedwoodShores/RedwoodShores.html) (Redwood Shores Bay Trail) and [All Trails](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/redwood-shores-loop-trail?mobileMap=false&ref=sidebar-static-map&ref=sidebar-view-full-map) (Redwood Shores Loop Trail).

*I really like the layers of water, grass, and rocks in the photo above, what do you think?*

There are several entry points along the trail. For this trip, we parked on Tiller Lane and walked across Mariner Park (which is just a large field) to get onto the trail. We then headed northeast on the gravel path. We saw backyards to the left of us and the marsh and the slough to our right. There were a few bikers and people walking, but the road is wide enough for people to social distance.

We didn’t stay on the trail for long since there wasn’t much to see or do. I wouldn't recommend anyone to plan a trip just for this trail. Small disclaimer that I might be a little biased because I ended up with a mosquito bite that swelled up and covered half of my left arm for a week. I know, I know. I didn't really give this place a fair shot, so I will probably try out a different part of the trail one day and update this post.
