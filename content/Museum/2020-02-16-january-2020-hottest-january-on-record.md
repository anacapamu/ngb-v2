According to the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov/news/january-2020-was-earth-s-hottest-january-on-record), January 2020 was the hottest January in 141 years. I am not surprised because my strawberry plants started bearing fruits and my blue burrito are budding like it is spring already. ![photo of strawaberry plant one 2/15/2020](https://i.imgur.com/uIzRHda.jpg)This strawberry plant has historically given me odd-shaped strawberries as seen in pictures from almost a year ago. ![photo collage of odd-shaped strawberries](https://i.imgur.com/1XXLePN.png) ![photo of blue burrito plants 2/15/2020](https://i.imgur.com/n0M741v.jpg) I started off with four blue burrito plants but now I have five. The heat wave back around June or July 2019 made one lose its "head" (the one on the left that has only a stem sticking up) and two had to go through "rehab" for months before its leaves looked plump and healthy again. ![another photo of blue burrito plants 5/27/2019](https://i.imgur.com/BMndGcc.jpg)
