Pura Vida has two monthly subscription boxes: Bracelet Club and Jewelry Club. You get at least three bracelets each month (USD 45+ value, according to their website) when you subscribe to the Bracelet Club. It is $14.95 a month including shipping; but it is cheaper if you prepay for 6 months or a year. Every month, you can choose between two different styles.

The mailer has the exact same design as the January and February ones, so I just used an old photo. However, there is a surprise small pouch with a freebie bracelet that is not pictured here.

The info cards are the same as the previous months. The monthly sticker for March is a hand crossing two fingers, probably referring to the luck of the Irish.

I thought both were cute but I went with the So Minty Fresh one. The three bracelets included are 1) a light orange braided bracelet with silver hammered circle charms, 2) a pastel green (minty) original bracelet, and 3) a beads/link double chain bracelet.</figcaption>

I don't know the frequency that Pura Vida gives out an additional bracelet as they don't announce it on their Instagram. But the freebie bracelet is a light blue bracelet with a charm of a circle with an outline of a mountain (oops charm is upside down in the photo).
