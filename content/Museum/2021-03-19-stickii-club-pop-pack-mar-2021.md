Stickii Club offers three different types of monthly sticker subscriptions: Cute, Pop, and Vintage. The packs are differentiated by color: pink for Cute, aqua for Pop, and gold for Vintage. Each pack is $10 per month plus tax and shipping and comes with at least six sticker sheets and at least three stationery items.

This is the first time I ordered the pop pack since they changed the color of the envelope from purple to aqua.

    <figcaption>The theme for this pack is "Light &amp; Shadow." Stickii Club was going for a specific color palette this month, so this is their black and white pack. It is also the only pack this month that has a stamp. I am not a big fan of black and white stickers but I do like the phases of moon stamp.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>This pack also includes 2 art prints from @suri_draws that are printed on glossy photo paper. I am indifferent to witches, but I still think these look great on my art wall.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>I don't really have much to say about the stickers in this pack as none of them really stand out. I got this pack mainly for the stamp and the postcards.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>I am glad they included a description that these are index stickers and how to use them. Before reading the description, I thought these were weirdly elongated hourglasses stickers.</figcaption>
