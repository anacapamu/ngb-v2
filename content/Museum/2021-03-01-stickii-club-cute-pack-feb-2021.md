Stickii Club offers three different types of monthly sticker subscriptions: Cute, Pop, and Vintage. The packs are differentiated by color: pink for Cute, aqua for Pop, and gold for Vintage. Each pack is $10 per month plus tax and shipping and comes with at least six sticker sheets and at least three stationery items.

I got the Cute Pack this month because of how much I loved the sheets they spoiled on Instagram. The pack included a postcard ad for Hanami, Stickii Club's first stationery box.

The theme for this pack is *Starry Night*. Two stationery items are included: a memo pad and a clear stamp. This is the first time Stickii Club is offering clear stamps and one of the main reasons why I got this pack.

The pack always includes a sticker sheet with the same art as the theme sticker. This time, we get a sticker sheet and washi tape samplers of the *Starry Night* theme. I am a little surprised the background of these sheets is not black like the theme sticker.

Isn't this space food sheet by @imaginstation just adorable?

Stickii Club partnered with Pusheen, so every Cute Pack for 2021 will include an exclusive Pusheen sticker sheet.

This sticker sheet is by the same artist that designed this month's memo pad.

The pack always includes at least one sheet from the in-house artist that isn't the theme sticker sheet.

I believe Stickii Club has collaborated with @jennillustrations multiple times in the past.

All the gold foil stickers on the Mandie Kuo sheet were misprinted, so all the affected stickers are off-centered and not usable. I contacted customer support and, as always, they responded quickly. They said that they would replace the sheet if they had any extra and if not, they would send two other sticker sheets.

These are the two sticker sheets they sent. I do see the misprinted sheet on sale in their shop, so I am surprised they didn't send an actual replacement. I am a little disappointed at the recent quality control, as this is the second time in a row I had an issue with an order. I am subscribed for the March pack, so hopefully, there won't be any issue with that one.
