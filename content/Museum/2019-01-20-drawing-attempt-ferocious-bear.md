This ferocious bear from *Total Drama* made me want to draw. Since my SO recently bought the new iPad that is compatible with the Apple Pencil, I borrowed his iPad and Apple Pencil to experiment. This will be my first time drawing using the Apple Pencil and Adobe Sketch.

While the sketch did not turn out too badly, I didn't expect the green watercolor to bleed into the outline of the bear. You can also tell where I pressed harder with the Pencil in the background. I definitely need to learn how to color more smoothly.

To avoid bleeding, I used two layers. I outlined the bear and then I duplicated it to create the second layer. In the first layer, I colored the bear. I decided to go with watercolor and it turned out quite smooth. In the second layer, I did the green background. There is not as much bleeding in this attempt; however, in some areas, you can see a second green outline around the bear. Maybe I should have just made the second layer the green background and first layer the colored bear. Or maybe I should have gone with three layers: one with the green background, one with the outline of the bear, and the last one with the outline of the bear but colored.

As you can tell, I do not have a background nor talent in drawing. I did not start with much of a plan and the bear's face is not symmetrical in either attempt. In the first attempt, the entire bear was lopsided to the right before I cropped the image. In addition, I still do not really understand watercolor or layers, so drawing will definitely be a slow work in progress for me.
